# Portfolio Assignment for Class 1 - Mobile-First and Responsive Design

# Your professional online presence

> Turned everything from the assignment README into tasks.

Some hints to get going:

- [x] Start a fresh new repository for this project on GitHub.
- [x] Start with a pen & paper "wireframe" sketch of what you want your portfolio site to look like. You are expected to create completely original styling for your portfolio, so take the time to decide how you want the portfolio to look. The more specificity you can provide, the easier it will be to write the CSS. You can always modify the styling as you progress, but it's very hard to create styling if you don't have a clear picture of how the finished product should look and behave.
- [x] Make a JS constructor function to model your project data. Think about what properties you would need to accurately model a coding project.
- [ ] Work through as many of the user stories as you can, but always submit what you have by the due date. Don't let "if only..." ideas keep you from turning something in!
- [x] Add the [.eslintrc]() config file to the root of your repo, so we are all on the same linter settings.
- [x] Also include a .[gitignore] (https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-301n5/blob/master/.gitignore) file in your root directory to prevent non-relevant files from being pushed to GitHub.

Follow along with these user stories to make sure your portfolio looks good on any sized device.

Adapt these stories as necessary to fit how you want to build your portfolio.

## User Stories: MVP
Let these user stories guide your development:
  - [ ] As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
  - [x] As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
  - [ ] As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
    - [x] index.html _(Home)_
    - [ ] portfolio.html
    - [ ] blog.html
    - [ ] contact.html
  - [ ] As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.
  - [X] As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
  - [X] As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
  - [ ] As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals (*not required*, adapt to fit your portfolio's design)
  - [ ] As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
- [x] Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects that contains properties appropriate for a portfolio project.
- [ ] Leave as little in the `window` (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- [x] Use strict mode in all .js files.
- [ ] When you have finished your wireframes and data model, present them to the instructors for approval.
- [x] Include a CSS reset
- [ ] The nav menu should be hidden by default in mobile mode and should display when the user clicks the hamburger icon.
- [ ] Be sure to use proper `viewport` settings.
- [ ] Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
  - [ ] Make sure to scale images
- [ ] Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.
- [ ] For bonus points, include styles for tablet displays, as well as desktop and mobile.
